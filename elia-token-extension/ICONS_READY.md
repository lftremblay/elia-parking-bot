# 🎨 Icons - Ready to Go!

## ✅ What Just Happened

I opened `create_icons.html` in your browser, which will automatically:
1. Generate 3 icons (16x16, 48x48, 128x128 pixels)
2. Display them with preview
3. Allow you to download them

---

## 📋 Quick Steps (2 Minutes)

### In the Browser Window That Just Opened:

1. **Icons are already generated** - you'll see 3 yellow icons with "E"
2. **Click "💾 Download All Icons"** button
3. **Move the 3 downloaded files** to:
   ```
   elia-token-extension/icons/
   ```

### Files to Move:
- `icon16.png` → `elia-token-extension/icons/icon16.png`
- `icon48.png` → `elia-token-extension/icons/icon48.png`
- `icon128.png` → `elia-token-extension/icons/icon128.png`

---

## 🚀 Next: Step 2 - Load Extension

Once icons are in place:

1. Open Chrome: `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle top-right)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select folder: `elia-token-extension`
5. Extension loads! ✅

## 🎨 Icon Design

The icons feature:
- **Background**: #ffd200 (Vidéotron yellow)
- **Letter**: "E" for Elia
- **Style**: Bold, centered, professional
- **Format**: PNG with transparency

## ⚡ Alternative: Manual Icon Creation

If the browser method doesn't work, you can:

### Option 1: Use Any Image
1. Find any 3 PNG images
2. Rename to: icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png
3. Place in icons folder
4. Extension will work (icons just won't look perfect)

### Option 2: Online Generator
1. Visit: https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Upload any image
3. Download all sizes
4. Rename and place in icons folder

---

## ✅ Ready for Step 2!

Once you've moved the 3 icon files to the icons folder, you're ready to load the extension in Chrome!

**The browser window with the icon generator should be open now. Just click "Download All Icons" and move the files!** 🎨
